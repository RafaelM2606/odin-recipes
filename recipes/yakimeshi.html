    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
            <li>1 green onion/scallion</li>
            <li>2 slices of ham</li>
            <li>1 large egg </li>
            <li>2 Tbsp neutral oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp white pepper powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice that is day-old, remove it from the refrigerator and heat it in the microwave until it‘s room temperature or slightly warm. If you are using freshly cooked rice, transfer the hot rice to a baking sheet. Spread it out and let it cool completely. This will remove the moisture from the rice.</li>
            <li>Cut the white part of 1 green onion/scallion into rounds and the green part diagonally. Keep the white and green parts separate and set aside. Reserve a few green slices for the garnish.</li>
            <li>Dice 2 slices ham into square pieces ½ inch (1.3 cm) wide.</li>
            <li>Crack and whisk 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat the wok (or a large frying pan) on medium-high heat. Once it’s hot, add half of the 2 Tbsp neutral oil and swirl it around to make sure it coats the entire surface of the wok. Add the beaten egg to the hot wok. After a few seconds, the egg will start to float on top of the oil.</li>
            <li>With the blunt end of a spatula, swirl the loosely set egg around the pan to keep it fluffy while continuing to cook it. When the bottom of the egg is set but the top is still a bit runny and not quite fully cooked, transfer it to a plate. We do not want to overcook the egg at this stage.</li>
            <li>Add the other half of the oil to the pan. Then, add the ham and white part of the chopped green onion. Stir-fry and coat well with the oil.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked and cooled rice to the wok. With the spatula, use a slicing motion to separate the rice clumps without mashing or breaking the rice grains. Combine it with the ham mixture and continue to toss the rice so it is coated with oil and develops a nice char.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked egg back to the wok and break it into smaller pieces while you combine it with the rice.</li>
            <li>Season the rice with 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/8 tsp white pepper powder.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tsp soy sauce and toss to distribute it throughout the rice</li>
            <li>Add the green part of the chopped green onion. Taste the fried rice and adjust the seasoning if needed. After tossing the rice a few more times, transfer it to a plate.</li>
